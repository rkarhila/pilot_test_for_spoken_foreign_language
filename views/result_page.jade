      h3 1. Pronunciation clarity within the population of Finnish High School students

      p The chart below shows a mapping from computational score to human evaluation. 
        | Samples from the training data are shown. The blue dots show median evaluation, and 
        | the error bars encompass the complete variety of human evaluations for that particular speaker.
        | The human evaluation is based on a 10-step scale, where every step has been
        | described:
        uul
          li 1: Pronunciation causes major difficulties in understanding
          li 2: Pronunciation causes frequent difficulties in understanding
          li 3: Pronunciation sometimes causes difficulties in understanding
          li 4:  Pronunciation is understandable, although foreign accent is very apparent and pronunciation mistakes can cause understanding problems
          li 5: Pronunciation is understandable, although foreign accent is very apparent and there are pronunciation mistakes
          li 6: Pronunciation is clearly understandable, although foreign accent is apparent and there are infrequent pronunciation mistakes
          li 7: Pronunciation is very understandable, although intonation and weighting are not according to target language
          li 8: Pronunciation and intonation are clear and natural. 
          li 9: Pronunciation and intonation are very clear and natural. 
          li 10: Able to vary intonation and communicate the most subtlest of meanings via prosodic weighting

        | As is apparent from the chart, the reviewers are using the scale in a varying manners.

      h3 3. Plotted fluency
      p.
        These wavelet pictures show the prosodic structure of your utterances with word boundaries, pauses and intonation. 
        You can see the rhythm of the utterance as well as sentence stress and even word stress. 
        The bigger the font in the text below, the more stressed (prominent) the word is. 
        Red color shows energy (louder & higher voice) and blue color shows silence (pauses). 
        Large and clear red/yellow ”arc” means a clear information structure (e.g. sentence), small red/yellow pilars reveal hesitations and machine-like production.

      p.
        Have a look at these annotated examples:
